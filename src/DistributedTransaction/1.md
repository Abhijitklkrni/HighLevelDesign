## What is a transaction?
A transaction is a **series of actions **that must be executed successfully. Even if one of the operations fails, the entire steps must be rolled back to leave the application in the previous stable state. A transaction has the following ACID properties

1. **Atomicity:**
    - **Scenario:** A customer places an order for a product.
    - **Actions:**
        - The order service deducts the ordered quantity from the inventory.
        - The payment service processes the payment.
    - **Atomicity Ensures:** If the deduction from inventory is successful but the payment processing fails (e.g., due to a network issue), the entire transaction is rolled back.
2. **Consistency:**
    - **Scenario:** Ensuring that the inventory remains accurate and consistent with the actual stock.
    - **Actions:**
        - The order service deducts the ordered quantity from the inventory.
    - **Consistency Ensures:** If the inventory level drops below a certain threshold after the deduction, the system ensures that the transaction is rolled back, maintaining the consistency of the inventory. This prevents scenarios where orders are accepted even when the stock is insufficient.
3. **Isolation:**
    - **Scenario:** Multiple customers place orders simultaneously.
    - **Actions:**
        - Customer A's order service is deducted from the inventory.
        - Customer B's order service also deducts from the inventory.
    - **Isolation Ensures:** Each order service runs independently, and the transactions are isolated from each other. Customer A doesn't see the intermediate state of Customer B's order, and vice versa. This prevents interference between concurrent transactions.
4. **Durability:**
    - **Scenario:** After successful deduction from inventory and payment processing, ensure that the data persists.
    - **Actions:**
        - The order service deducts the ordered quantity from the inventory.
        - The payment service processes the payment.
    - **Durability Ensures:** Once the inventory deduction and payment processing are committed, the changes are stored persistently. In case of a system failure or restart, the committed state is recovered from durable storage, and the system resumes with the correct, consistent data.


**Transactions in Monolith and Microservices**
In a traditional Monolithic application, there will be a single large application connecting to a single large database and such applications stick to ACID properties.

The transaction boundary starts inside the service layer and can be committed or rolled back based on the outcome of all the steps in that transaction.



In the case of Microservices, each microservice runs a specific business area and maintains the **Single Repository Principle(SRP)**, which means each microservice maintains its own database and another service should not the other service’s database directly. So the transactions are distributed across the microservices.

Example: Let us consider an online order processing for the Monolith and Microservices Architecture for the below scenario

- The user adds a product to a cart on an e-commerce site and buys it
- An order is created for the user with an order number generated
- The item stock is reduced by 1 as the user has bought the product
- Payment has been completed successfully


In the Monolith application, all the steps take place inside a single application and single database. All the steps are executed from a service class; if any of the steps fail, the whole transaction can be rolled back.

In the case of a Microservice application, each of the above steps takes place individually inside the specific microservice and its specific database



- Order will be processed in the Order service
- Stocks are checked and calculated inside the Inventory Service
- Payment is processed in the Payment service


Since each of the steps runs inside a different microservice and its database, maintaining the ACID principle for the entire transaction is extremely difficult and complicated. It is better to avoid distributed transaction management completely if possible.



## Patterns for Distributed Transaction Management


1. **Synchronous Patterns**
- Two-Phase Commit
- Three Phase Commit


2. **Asynchronous Pattern**

- Orchestration-Based Saga Pattern
- Choreography-Based Saga Pattern








**Two-Phase Commit (2 PC)**



2 Phase Commit is a standard protocol to handle distributed transactions using 2 stages namely **Prepare stage and the Commit stage.** There is a transaction coordinator component that coordinates the entire transaction by talking to all the services



consider three microservices: Order Service, Payment Service, and Inventory Service.

1. **Transaction Initiation (Coordinator):**
    - The Order Service receives a request to place an order and initiates a transaction.
    - The Order Service acts as the coordinator for the transaction.
2. **Voting Phase (Prepare Phase):**
    - The Order Service sends a prepare message to all participating microservices, including the Payment Service and Inventory Service.
    - Each participating microservice (Payment Service, Inventory Service) checks whether it can fulfill its part of the transaction. If everything is in order, they reply with a vote "Yes." Otherwise, they reply with a vote "No."
3. **Decision Phase (Commit or Abort):**
    - If all microservices voted "Yes," the Order Service sends a commit message to all participating microservices.
    - If any microservice voted "No," the Order Service sends an abort message to all participating microservices.
4. **Commit Phase:**
    - If the decision is to commit, all participating microservices (Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service) execute the actual changes needed to fulfill the transaction.
    - For example, the Order Service records the order, the Payment Service processes the payment, and the Inventory Service updates the available inventory.
5. **Acknowledgment Phase:**
    - After successful execution, each microservice sends an acknowledgment back to the Order Service.
6. **Completion:**
    - If all acknowledgments are received, the Order Service considers the transaction complete and sends a response to the client indicating success.
    - If any acknowledgment is missing or if any microservice encountered an issue during execution, the Order Service can initiate compensation actions or notify the client of a failure.


**Drawbacks of 2PC**

**Coordination Overhead:**

- 2PC involves a significant amount of coordination between the coordinator and participants. The need for multiple rounds of communication and synchronization can introduce overhead, impacting the overall system performance and scalability.
  **Single Point of Failure:**

- The coordinator acts as a single point of failure. If the coordinator fails after participants have committed changes but before it sends the final commit message, the system can be left in an inconsistent state
  **Blocking:**

- One of the major drawbacks of 2PC is its blocking nature. During the protocol execution, all participants are blocked from processing other transactions until a final decision (commit or abort) is reached. This can lead to performance issues, especially in systems with high contention for resources.
- If someone has a problem during this process, like a technical issue or a disagreement, everyone has to wait until the issue is resolved or the decision is made to cancel the entire transaction.
  **Blocking during Coordinator Failure:**

- If the coordinator fails after sending the commit message but before participants receive it, participants might be left uncertain about the final decision. In this case, participants can independently decide to commit or abort based on a timeout. If they don't receive a coordinator's message within a certain time frame, they may choose to abort and roll back changes. Hence came 3 PC to rectify some disadvantages.


**Some failure scenarios **

Here are some common failure scenarios in the 2PC protocol:

1. **Participant Failure during Prepare Phase:**
    - A participant may fail after sending a "Yes" vote during the prepare phase. In this case, the coordinator may not receive the acknowledgment, and the coordinator's timeout mechanism will trigger the abort phase.
2. **Participant Failure during Commit Phase:**
    - A participant may fail after committing changes locally but before sending the acknowledgment during the commit phase. The coordinator, not receiving the acknowledgment, will assume a failure and initiate the abort phase.
3. **Coordinator Failure after Sending Commit Message:**
    - The coordinator may fail after sending the commit message but before participants receive it. Participants, not receiving a message within a specified time, may independently decide to abort and roll back changes.
4. **Network Issues:**
    - Network issues can lead to message loss or delays in communication between the coordinator and participants. If acknowledgments are not received within the timeout period, the coordinator may initiate the abort phase.
5. **Mixed Votes from Participants:**
    - If some participants vote "Yes" to commit and others vote "No" during the prepare phase, the coordinator will initiate the abort phase.
6. **Coordinator Failure after Receiving Votes:**
    - If the coordinator fails after receiving "Yes" votes but before sending the commit message, participants might be left in an uncertain state. They may independently decide to commit or abort based on a timeout.
7. **Indefinite Blocking:**
    - In scenarios where messages are lost or delayed, participants may be indefinitely blocked, waiting for acknowledgments. This can happen if the coordinator fails to receive acknowledgments from participants.
8. **Timeouts and Unresponsiveness:**
    - Timeouts are critical in 2PC, and if participants or the coordinator become unresponsive, it can lead to the protocol relying on timeout mechanisms, triggering the abort phase.




**When to choose 2 PC**

1. **Data Consistency in Distributed Systems:** In distributed systems, maintaining data consistency can be challenging. If your application requires strong consistency guarantees, especially when multiple nodes are involved, 2PC can be a suitable choice.
2. **Critical Business Transactions:** In situations where the success or failure of a transaction has significant business implications, using 2PC can provide a higher level of reliability and data integrity.
3. **Financial Transactions:** In financial applications where transactions must be executed reliably and consistently across multiple systems, 2PC may be considered to ensure that financial data remains accurate.

**3 Phase Commit**



** Why 3 PC was introduced?**

In 2 PC, If a few participants sent Ok / yes during voting phase, means they are ready to commit. But they are blocked as they are waiting if all others are also ready.

Now if the coordinator dies, these participants will never get to know that they should commit or roll back. They will be blocked until a Commit or Rollback message is sent from the coordinator or the request timesout. Thus the **2PC technique is a blocking protocol**.



3PC introduces an extra phase (Pre-commit Phase) compared to the traditional 2-phase commit. This extra phase helps** reduce the likelihood of blocking issues** and enhances the overall reliability of the distributed transaction.

If the coordinator fails before sending a preCommit message, other participants will unanimously agree that the operation was aborted.



**3 PC is an extension of a two-phase commit** wherein the commit phase is split into two phases as follows.

**1) Prepare to commit**, After unanimously receiving yes in the first phase of the 2PC / **Voting Phase (Prepare Phase), ** the coordinator asks all participants to prepare to commit. During this phase, all participants acquire locks, etc, but they don’t actually commit.

**2) Do Commit - **If the coordinator receives yes from all participants during the prepare to commit phase then it asks all participants to commit.



The pre-commit phase introduced above helps us to recover from the case when a participant fails or both the coordinator and participant node fail** during the commit phase**.

Steps in 3PC if the coordinator dies in the commit phase -

1) Now when the coordinator fails, **the secondary coordinator **takes charge of coordinating.

2) Then It **queries all the participants about their status**.

3) If it learns that **some nodes are in the commit phase** then it assumes that the previous coordinator before crashing has made the decision **to commit**. Hence it can ask all the participants to commit

4) But if participants says that it doesn’t receive **prepare to commit,** then the new coordinator can assume that the previous coordinator failed even before it started the prepare to commit phase. Hence it can safely assume no other participant would have committed the changes and hence safely abort the transaction.



**Drawbacks of the Three-Phase Commit Protocol:**

While the three-phase commit (3PC) protocol addresses some issues present in the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol, it comes with its own set of disadvantages and complexities.



**Increased Complexity:**

- 3PC introduces an additional phase (Pre-commit Phase), making the protocol more complex to implement and understand compared to 2PC.
  **Increased Latency:**

- The introduction of an extra phase in 3PC, the Pre-commit Phase, adds to the overall transaction time. This increased latency can be a concern in systems where low-latency transactions are crucial.
- **Other services must wait until the slowest service finishes** its confirmation. The resources used by the services are locked until the whole transaction is complete.
  **Blocking During Recovery:**

- While 3PC reduces the chances of indefinite blocking, there can still be scenarios where recovery coordinators need to wait for responses from all participants, leading to potential blocking during recovery.
  **Not Truly Decentralized:**

- 3PC still relies on a central coordinator to make decisions and coordinate the distributed transaction.
  **Message Complexity:**

- The three-phase commit protocol involves more messages exchanged between the coordinator and participants compared to the two-phase commit. Increased message complexity can lead to higher communication overhead.
  **Inability to Handle Fail-Stop Models:**

- 3PC assumes a fail-noisy model, where participants can fail and then recover. **In fail-stop models, where a participant fails and does not recover**, 3PC may not be able to handle the situation well.
  **Dependency on Synchronous Communication:**

- 3PC relies on synchronous communication between the coordinator and participants, which might not be ideal in distributed systems where asynchronous communication is preferred.


**Synchronicity Trade-offs:**

- Synchronous communication ensures a **more deterministic and predictable flow of the protocol but may introduce latency.**


If you are ok with the **Eventual Consistency and Compensation **then go for SAGA Design Model, This model doesn’t enforce distributed ACID transactions across microservices. Instead, it proposes to use some mechanisms to ensure that the system would be eventually consistent at some point in the future.

** So when to choose Sync and when to choose Async?**

**Sync - In financial transactions**

- The financial transaction involves a straightforward operation: deducting money from one account and crediting it to another.
- Strong consistency is a non-negotiable requirement to prevent any discrepancies in account balances.
- Blocking during the commit phase, even in case of failures, is acceptable because maintaining financial integrity is the top priority.
- The 2PC protocol ensures that both accounts are updated atomically. If any participant (e.g., one of the accounts or the transaction coordinator) fails, the protocol ensures that the system reaches a consistent state.


**Async - In e-commerce **

- The order processing involves multiple services that can function independently. There is no need for a tightly coordinated, all-or-nothing transaction.
- If the payment service fails, the system can initiate a compensating transaction to cancel the order or release the reserved inventory without affecting other services.
- The Saga pattern supports loose coupling and allows for partial rollbacks, making it suitable for complex, distributed workflows.
- Each service (inventory, payment, shipping) handles its part of the transaction independently. If a failure occurs in one service, compensating transactions are triggered to maintain consistency.
  In summary, 2PC is suitable for scenarios requiring strong consistency and atomicity, where blocking during the commit phase is acceptable. On the other hand, the Saga pattern is a good fit for scenarios with loosely coupled, independent services, where partial rollbacks and compensating transactions are necessary for handling failures in a distributed environment.
