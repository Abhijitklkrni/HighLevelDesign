JAVA
- platform independent
- object-oriented
- WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
  - Abstract Machine - does not exist physically
  - JVM is platform dependent

  - JIT (Just In Time) compiler : converts byte code to machine code 

- JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
  - JVM + Class Libraries (java.util,javax.swing,java.io,java.net,java.lang)

  - JVM needs class libraries to execute the code
  - if we have JRE, we can only run the java programs, we cannot compile/code the java programs

- JDK (Java Development Kit)
  - JRE + Development Tools (javac,debugger, java, jar, javadoc) 

- JSE (Java Standard Edition)
- JEE (Java Enterprise Edition/Jakarta EE)

- JME (Java Micro Edition)

Why only one public class in a file?
- If we have multiple public classes in a file, then JVM will not be able to identify which class to execute first/which class is the main class


Q. Map vs flatMap
- map - 1 to 1 mapping
- flatMap - 1 to many mapping
