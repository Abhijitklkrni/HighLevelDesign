**Q:** While designing, is it better to ask client to upload the media to S3 or File storage and pass on the media path to the backend or pass all the data with media to backend and backend should upload to file storage or S3? which is the better approach?



The best approach depends on various factors including the nature of your application, scalability requirements, security considerations, and client preferences. Here are some considerations for both approaches:

**Client Uploads to S3/File Storage:**

1. **Efficiency:** Directly uploading media from the client to storage (such as S3 or file storage) can be more efficient as it reduces server load.

2. **Scalability:** Offloading the upload process to the client can help scale the backend server more effectively, especially in scenarios with high concurrency.

3. **Latency:** Client-side uploads can reduce latency by eliminating the need for data to travel through the backend server before reaching storage.

4. **Security:** Depending on your security requirements, you may need to implement measures such as access control policies and encryption to secure media uploads directly from clients.

**Backend Uploads:**

1. **Control:** Uploading media through the backend gives you more control over the upload process. You can implement additional validation, processing, and security measures before storing the media.

2. **Data Integrity:** Handling uploads on the backend allows you to perform data integrity checks and validation before accepting the media, reducing the risk of corrupted or malicious files being uploaded.

3. **Business Logic:** If your application requires additional business logic or processing (e.g., generating thumbnails, extracting metadata), handling uploads on the backend may be necessary.

4. **Client Complexity:** Offloading uploads to clients may add complexity to client-side code, especially if handling large files or dealing with unreliable network connections.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on your specific requirements and constraints. It's essential to carefully evaluate the trade-offs and consider factors such as performance, scalability, security, and ease of implementation before deciding on an approach. Additionally, consulting with your client to understand their preferences and requirements can help inform your decision.

- UDP for WebRTC
